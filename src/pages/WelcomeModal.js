        This is my website, where I mostly share updates on the projects Iâ€™m working on and document 
        my journey as I get better at coding and explore new projects. The website itself is one of 
        my long-term projects, with the goal of improving my frontend development skills, particularly in JavaScript and React.

        Since this site is a work in progress, you may encounter some missing or underdeveloped features. For a more detailed overview, 
        the Projects Overview section provides insights into the progress and goals of all my various projects.

        You might also come across a bugâ€”or maybe two or threeâ€”along the way ðŸ¤ .
